## **Project Scope:**
The project consists of 2 **major component**:
- Timetable scheduling
- Facilities booking

Timetable scheduling combines team members timetable and identify the time slots where none of the team members has lesson. Team members are capped at maximum 10 pax.

Facilities booking is intended for students to book the facilities within NUS after a free slot is chosen. However, the facilities booking are reserved for lecturers only. Therefore, a mock data will be used in place to simulate the booking process.

## **Milestone 1 (Ideation)**

### Project Motivation:

With the ease of COVID-19 restrictions, physical meetings is becoming more frequent. However, with the increasing number of student, scheduling a meet up is difficult to coordinate. Moreover, since there are many empty tutorial rooms, the rooms can be further utilised for meeting through bookings. 

### Core Features:
The core features includes **timetable scheduling** and **facilities booking**.

Timetable Scheduling: All the members involved in the meeting will send the NUSMods Timetable share link to one representative. All modules of the teammates will be combined and will chun out the available/possible timeslot available to meetup. For simplicity, the range of time is set from 0800 to 2359, Monday to Friday.

Facilities Booking: Students will log into the website to book the facilities based on the selected date. Facilities that are being booked will be blocked off to prevent other students from booking.


### User Stories:
As a project leader, I find it an hassle to manually compare the timetable between my teammates just to find a slot for meeting.

During project meeting, it's often distracting as there are always people moving around. I want to have a meeting spot where we can discussed without being affected by the surrounding
