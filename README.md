## **Milestone 1 (Ideation)**

### Project Motivation:

With the ease of COVID-19 restrictions, physical meetings is becoming more frequent. However, with the increasing number of student, scheduling a meet up is difficult to coordinate. Moreover, since there are many empty tutorial rooms, the rooms can be further utilised for meeting through bookings.

### Core Features:

The core features includes **timetable scheduling** and **facilities booking**.

Timetable Scheduling: All the members involved in the meeting will send the NUSMods Timetable share link to one representative. All modules of the teammates will be combined and will chun out the available/possible timeslot available to meetup. For simplicity, the range of time is set from 0800 to 2359, Monday to Friday.

Venues Search: Based on the selected date/time, venues would be shown to the students .

### User Stories:

As a project leader, I find it an hassle to manually compare the timetable between my teammates just to find a slot for meeting.

During project meeting, it's often distracting as there are always people moving around. I want to have a meeting spot where we can discussed without being affected by the surrounding
